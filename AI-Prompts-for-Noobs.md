Always begin with platform choice
Claude is a better writer and programmer, but tends to be very wordy

Gemini and ChatGPT have live connections to internet

Gemini has access to Google Docs/etc...

CoPilot has access to MS-Office and VS Code.

.......
Create a Persona for your "Assistant", ChatGPT has a special area where you can
add details to the persona, as well as provide additional instructions.

Don't think this is odd, or silly, if you don't you will find that your assistant
will start to forget things in long conversational threads. even if you are
programming, it may start to forget to "explain" what it is doing, or it may drop
an otherwise important detail for function it could forget that it is supposed to
type out the developed code model so you can copy/paste/execute it.
